# Detecting-Adversarial-Texts-via-Embeddings-and-Logit-Analysis
By examining token-level embeddings and analyzing raw model logits before softmax activation, the method aims to capture inconsistencies introduced by adversarial perturbations. The approach is evaluated against the TextFooler adversarial attack, with a focus on understanding detection performance and model behavior.
